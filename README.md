# jSharkanoid

A clone of classic arcade game Arkanoid written in javascript and shark themed. There are block-shaped sea life at the top of the screen that the user must consume by sending a shark at them. The shark ricochets on blocks, the top, left, and rights sides of the screen, and a deployment pad at the bottom of the screen that the user uses the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to move.
